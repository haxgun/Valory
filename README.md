Valory provides a beautiful rank overlay for your stream.
Overlay under the hood runs on vanilla JS, so it has minimal load on your PC.

Project was inspired by the work of [davizeragod](https://davizeragod.github.io/) and [tracker.gg/overlays](https://tracker.gg/overlays).
Initially, the project was a fork of [davizeragod](https://davizeragod.github.io/), but then it began to exist as a separate project.

## ✨ Features
* Overlay runs on vanilla JS
* Beautiful, modern design
* It has the possibility of customization. For example, changing the color of components or removing unnecessary components


## 📋 TODO
- [ ] Add instructions on how to connect an overlay to a stream
- [ ] Add a real-time preview update
- [ ] Add more information
- [ ] Add the ability to change the background for the preview
